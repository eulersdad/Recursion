The Tut:

commit is like a save, change the file and make a commit. 
Branching will come ahead

Commit:-
-Making a change, clck on commit changes with a small commit message

-We also have a commit hash, Unique hash for every commit.


Branching:- 
-A repo known as Recursion.  

We have a master branch, root of the tree. 
We can also have some other branch .

       /        \
      /           \
 BackTracking      ForwardRecursion
 
 
      
Since i committed to the backtracking branch, the master branch recursion doesnt have those changes. 


Now i liked the idea in backtacking i want to get it to the recursion file also.
