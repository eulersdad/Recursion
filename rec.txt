The Tut:

commit is like a save, change the file and make a commit. 
Branching will come ahead

Commit:-
-Making a change, clck on commit changes with a small commit message

-We also have a commit hash, Unique hash for every commit.


Branching:- 
-A repo known as Recursion.  

We have a master branch, root of the tree. 
We can also have some other branch .
          
          |
          |
        master
        /     \
       /        \
      /           \
 BackTracking      ForwardRecursion
 
 
      
Since i committed to the backtracking branch, the master branch recursion doesnt have those changes. 


Now i liked the idea in backtacking i want to get it to the recursion file also.

          |
        master
        /     \
       /        \
      /           \
 BackTracking      ForwardRecursion
      \
       \
        \
         master (recursion
         
         
go to the graph options to visualize your activity in a tree like structure. 


Something new is coming up as pull request and merge. 

         
Pull request is when you want to bring in some changes of one branch to another. 

Forking a repo: Taking an entire instance of some other repo and adding it to your own account. You maybe like a repo too much that you want an exact replica of it in your account.

When you go on editing a project, it automatically gives you an option to fork that project and then edit the file.
